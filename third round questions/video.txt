Ruby on Rails is a Web application framework that simplies web development 
by providing well defined struture .it follows the MVC architecture
Rails has rich pre built in tools and libraries that handles the 
database management , handling requests , routing.it also provides 
ecosystem to additional functionality to our web application using gems

gems are similiar to npm packages which can be installed in our 
application and use them as per the needs

transaction ensures that a series of database operations
 either all succeed or none of them are applied

 It wraps multiple database actions within a block, 
 and if any operation fails Rails automatically roll back
 it prevents partial updates

 In Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), 
 indexing is a technique used to 
 speed up the retrieval of data from a database
 indexes are commonly created on columns that are being 
 frequently retrived from the database

 Concerns When Creating New Indexes:
 write performance overhead: while indexes speeds up reads
 they slow write db operations  like INSERT,UPDATE
 because the database needs to update the index 
 whenever data in the indexed columns changes.

 Over-indexing: Creating too many indexes can lead to
  diminishing returns. Each additional index can introduce
   overhead reduces query performances
