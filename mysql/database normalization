First Normal Form
A table is supposed to be in first normal form if,



All the attributes are single-valued (atomic).
All the columns have unique names.
The order in which data is stored does not matter.
it maintains the data integrity



example
--------
userid  | firstname | lastname | address
5       |   atique  | bokhari | ballari,karnataka,583201

the above example is not in 1NF we need break address into different 
columns single value

user            
user_id         
Firstname
lastname
city
state
pincode


2NF
A table is supposed to be in second normal form if,

It should be in  1st normal form.
It does not have any partial dependency

example
Player_inventory
-------------
player_id
item_type
item_quantity
player_rating(partial dependency)

solution
player
-----
player_id
player_rating

Player_inventory
-------------
player_id
item_type
item_quantity

how non keys column relate to the primary key (player_id, item_type)

third normal form(3NF)

player
-----
player_id
player_rating
player_skill_level



problem
player_id -> {player_Skill_level}
{player_id} -> {player_Skill_level} -> {player_rating}

dependency non key attribute to non key attribute


solutions

player
-----
player_id(PK)
player_skill(FK)
--------------
player_skill_level
---------
id
player_rating


4NF
module_colour
-----
model
colord
style

model ->> color
model ->> color

multi valued dependencies in a table must be 


indexing
------

users
------
id(PK)
name(VARCHAR)
is_subscribed(boolean)
