Ruby memory management and Garbage Collection



A heap is a complete binary tree data structure that satisfies the heap property:
* In a max heap, every parent node is greater than or equal to its children.
* In a min heap, every parent node is less than or equal to its children.


Ruby uses two types of heap for memory allocation 
1. malloc heap(strings & data structures)
2. object heap(ruby object)


Ruby Garbage Collection explanation in general 

when an object is created memory is allocated for it. the object  stays for a while hopefully doing some work then after object is no longer in
use then ruby marks the section of the object memory as available for future use by another objects

Ruby heap is split into pages, pages contain slot, slot stores the object reference

Ruby uses mark sweep algorithm for Garbage Collection with tricolor mark

♻️ Ruby Garbage Collection Process
1. Initialization:

The Garbage Collector (GC) starts by tagging all objects in the heap with a white flag (considered unused for now).

2. Mark Phase – Reachability Analysis:

GC identifies all accessible (live) objects—these are reachable via variables/constants.

These are temporarily marked gray.

As GC traverses references from gray objects, they’re marked black (in-use), and traversal continues.

Objects still white after this are unreachable (garbage).

3. Sweep Phase – Memory Reclamation:

All white-flagged objects (unreachable) are deleted.

Their memory is returned to the heap.

This completes the sweep phase.
