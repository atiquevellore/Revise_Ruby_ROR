# Blocks example
=begin 
blocks are anoymous functions that can be passed into other function

the difference between  blocks and procs, lamda 
is that the blocks are not objects and procs and lamdas are the object


-Procs 

procs are the objects that encapsulate the block code 
they do not check the  number of arguments  and assign nil 
if they are missing

class User < ApplicationRecord
    scope :active,Proc.new { where(status: 'active')}
end

User.active


- lambdas 
lamdas are anyonomus function that are objects of Procs
the check the number of argument when invoked and raise error if there is
a mismatch

lambda_example = lambda {|name| puts "my  name is #{name}" }

lambda_example.call("david")


Ruby Clousures
a closure is a block of code that can be passed around and executed later, 
while retaining access to the variables in the scope where it was defined.

def greet
    name = "Alice"
    yield(name)
end

greet {|n| puts "Hello #{n}" }


demo_proc = Proc.new {|num1,num2| puts num1*num2}

[1].each(&demo_proc)
# will get nill error instead of number of arguments missing 


demo_lambda = lambda { |num1,num2| puts num1*num2}

will get number of arguments error

[1].each(&demo_lambda)

You're not alone! `super`, `super()`, and `super(args)` **can be confusing at first** ‚Äî but once you see them all side-by-side, it clicks. Let's break them down **with clear and complete examples**.

---

## üß† Understanding `super` Variants in Ruby

| Syntax       | What it does                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `super`      | Calls parent method with **same arguments** as current method |
| `super()`    | Calls parent method with **no arguments**                     |
| `super(arg)` | Calls parent method with **custom arguments**                 |

---

## ‚úÖ Let's define a base class: `Animal`

```ruby
class Animal
  def speak(sound = "generic sound")
    puts "Animal speaks: #{sound}"
  end
end
```

---

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ `super`: Passes same arguments as the current method

```ruby
class Dog < Animal
  def speak(sound)
    puts "Dog prepares to speak"
    super  # passes `sound` to Animal#speak
    puts "Dog finished speaking"
  end
end

Dog.new.speak("Woof")
```

üü¢ **Output:**

```
Dog prepares to speak
Animal speaks: Woof
Dog finished speaking
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `super()`: Passes **no arguments**, even if this method received some

```ruby
class Dog < Animal
  def speak(sound)
    puts "Dog prepares to speak"
    super()  # ignores sound, calls Animal#speak with no args
    puts "Dog finished speaking"
  end
end

Dog.new.speak("Woof")
```

üü° **Output:**

```
Dog prepares to speak
Animal speaks: generic sound
Dog finished speaking
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ `super("Bark")`: Passes **custom arguments**

```ruby
class Dog < Animal
  def speak(sound)
    puts "Dog prepares to speak"
    super("Bark")  # forces "Bark" to be passed regardless of input
    puts "Dog finished speaking"
  end
end

Dog.new.speak("Woof")
```

üü¢ **Output:**

```
Dog prepares to speak
Animal speaks: Bark
Dog finished speaking
```

---

## ‚úÖ Bonus: With `initialize` methods

```ruby
class Animal
  def initialize(name)
    puts "Animal initialized with name: #{name}"
  end
end

class Dog < Animal
  def initialize(name, breed)
    super(name)  # pass only name to Animal
    puts "Dog initialized with breed: #{breed}"
  end
end

Dog.new("Bruno", "Labrador")
```

üü¢ **Output:**

```
Animal initialized with name: Bruno
Dog initialized with breed: Labrador
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary Chart

| Use           | Effect                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `super`       | Passes all current arguments to parent |
| `super()`     | Passes **no** arguments                |
| `super(x, y)` | Passes only **specified** arguments    |
